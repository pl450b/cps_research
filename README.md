# Overview
STIX2 diagram of the threat actors we're researching \
*We're also using this to learn how stix works. If our workflow makes no sense, we're working on it*

## Main Points of Research
- CL0P
- Blackcat
- Anonymous Sudan 

# Usage
1. Add objects to *_stix.py files (organized by assigned entity)
2. Running the *_stix.py python files creates a JSON file called `view.py`
3. Upload the `view.json` file to the online [STIX Viewer](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-stix-visualization/) 
to see the mapping!
